# Prototypes in JS Lab

## Objectives
+ Refactor code to use prototypes
+ Ensure that each method is only declared one time yet can be referenced by the newly created objects

## Instructions
With our new knowledge of prototypes, we would like to refactor our previously written code to declare each function only one time.

In `index.js`, build an ES6 `BoardMember` class with the following properties set by the constructor: `name`, `training`, and `homeState`.

Add following methods to the prototype of the constructor:
+ `veto` — returns `No, I must disagree`

+ `approve` — returns `You can do that!`

+ `doCharity` — returns `I like to help people.`

+ `releasePressStatement` — returns `You will see great things from Scuber.`

+ `sayHi` — returns `"Hi, my name is <name>. I am from <homestate>, and I was trained in <training>.`
